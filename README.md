# Challenge-2
Portfolio webpage to be updated with evidence of work throughout the bootcamp.

The files were originally saved from the TA's starting files and their structure (there is an additional README.md inside the challenge file, which was from the TAs also). The README.md that has the heading Challenge-2 is mine.
This was an attempt at using all the skills learned up to the Challenge-2 point.
I don't have actual coding work to show so I have used images of pigeons instead.
I have had a few problems with this challenge, the problems came from the fact I kept changing my mind about the design I wanted (which I think created confusion and overloading of classes/ids). I had a go at using flexbox and grids nested into each other to attempt to create a visually interesting design, as well as adding roots for as many parts as possible for convenient editing.
I have built the website with greens, yellows, pinks and purples as these colours are complimentary and coming from an art background, these are colours I usually gravitate to when designing. Overall I wanted to have fun with the website design (I did); it is not amazing and the responsiveness of the site is minimal -I need to improve on @media selectors and simplifying my code, as well as learn more CSS.
